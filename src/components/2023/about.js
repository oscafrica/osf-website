            Open Source Community Africa is a community aimed at creating and supporting the open source movement within
            Africa. As a community, we intend to help integrate the act of open source contribution to African
            developers whilst strongly advocating the movement of free and open source software. <br />
            <br />
            Open Source Festival is a high profile event that would attract student delegates, developers, designers and
            corporate organizations on a large scale with series of talks, workshops, and awareness of open-sourced
            developer tools. The second edition is going to be a forum for networking, discussions and ideas proration
            around latest happenings in technology as well as the growth of open source in Africa. <br />
            <br />
            Through this festival, we intend to open the eyes of Africans so they can be aware that FUTURE IS OPEN.
