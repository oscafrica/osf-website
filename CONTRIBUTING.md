## Conventions

> Conventions include generic patterns that ensure that written code adheres to certain formatting conventions.

### Code

- Tabs or two-space indentation
- Use shorthand for conditional statements
- Always open braces on the same line as the previous statement and close braces on the same indent as the original function like so:
```js
function textComponent () {
  return {
    "name": "OSCA"
  };
}

```

### Naming 

- Constructor functions should use the TitleCase
- Variables, directories and methods should use the camelCase
- Variables or elements with multiple words should always use an underscore between words.
```js
const user_params = null;
```
- Private methods should start with a leading underscore to separate them from public methods
```js
const _inputType = inputType;
```
- Abbreviations should be avoided please to avoid confusion
- Comments should include enough information about what a part of code is supposed to do.
```js
// Define default props of the TextBox component
TextBox.defaultProps = {
    className: '',
    disabled: false,
    inputType: 'text'
};
```

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/osca).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
